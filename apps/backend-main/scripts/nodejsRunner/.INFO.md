# README

NOTE : Generic NodeJS project to run Node related tools on Python Files. (For Faster Development Purposes) (Ex. Nodemon, PyRight)
For each scripts in package.json we have created poetry task in "pyproject.toml" file. So we can run node scripts directly from poetry. (Ex. poetry run task dev)
