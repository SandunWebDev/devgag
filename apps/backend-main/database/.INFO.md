# Database Folder

#### This folder will contain

      - "Sqlite Database" File & It's Tables
          - Automatically created when we executed migration process related commands.
          - Ex. poetry run db-migrate-apply (See below "migrations folder" section for more info)
          - Assuming DB Path is "sqlite:///../../database/dev.db"

      - "migrations" folder.
        - Will be CREATED/UPDATED, As result of "Flask-Migrate" Plugin's commands such as "flask db init", "flask db migrate" and "flask db upgrade"
          - Normally "flask db init" and "flask db migrate" already ran and generated files are already committed to repo. We only need run these again when "Schema" has changed.
          - But we need to manually run "flask db upgrade" to apply migrations to actual database. (Only once, unless "Schema" changed)
          - We have added helper scripts for above commands. Such as "poetry run db-migrate-apply", Etc... Use them.

      - IMPORTANT NOTES
        - As mentioned above migrations files are created automatically from Model files. But some things are not correctly created in migrations files. (Ex. In filed "CHECK" constrains.) We have to manually added them in migration files.
        - So make sure check migrations files once "Schema Changed" and "Migrations" files have auto updated through commands.
