# Database Folder

#### This folder will contain

      - "Sqlite Database" File
          - Automatically created when Our Program's Code is being executed OR In migration process.
          - Assuming DB Path is "sqlite:///../../database/dev.db"

      - "migrations" folder.
        - As result of "Flask-Migrate" Plugin's commands such as "flask db init", "flask db migrate" and "flask db upgrade"
          - Normally "flask db init" and "flask db migrate" already ran and generated files are already committed to repo. We only need run these again when "Schema" has changed.
          - But we need to manually run "flask db upgrade" to apply migrations to actual database. (Only once, unless "Schema" changed)
          - We have added helper scripts for above commands. Such as "poetry run db-migrate-apply", Etc... Use them.
