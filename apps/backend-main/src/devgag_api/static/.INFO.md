# INFO

-   This folder should/will contain "Static Files" (CSS, Images, JS, Etc...) that will be used/referenced in "templates" folder files.
-   But In our project, Initial "Static Files" are created in "./backend-main/apps/frontend-assets/src" and then through "WebPack" we bundle all those together in neat, production ready, etc... way. Then we copy those bundled files into this "./backend-main/src/devgag-api/static/build" folder.
    -   All these happen automatically in build process. We don't have to worry about this folder or process directly. Regarding to this only folder matter is "./backend-main/apps/frontend-assets/src"
    -   Build process is mainly handled by "poetry run task dev" OR "poetry run task build-frontend-assets" scripts.
-   By the way, In production build, these static files are served from "NginX" server.
