# INFO

-   "./static/build" Folder

    -   This folder should/will contain "Static Files" (CSS, Images, JS, Etc...) that will be used/referenced in "templates" folder files.
    -   But In our project, Initial "Static Files" are created in "./backend-main/apps/frontend-assets/src" and then through "WebPack" we bundle all those together in neat, production ready, etc... way. Then we copy those bundled files into this "./backend-main/src/devgag-api/static/build" folder.
        -   All these happen automatically in build process. We don't have to worry about this folder or process directly. Regarding to this only folder matter is "./backend-main/apps/frontend-assets/src"
        -   Build process is mainly handled by "poetry run task dev" OR "poetry run task build-frontend-assets" scripts.
    -   By the way, In production build, these static files are served from "NginX" server.

-   "./static/uploads" Folder (As per ".env", UPLOAD_STORAGE_BASE_PATH and UPLOAD_STORAGE_FOLDER_NAME)
    -   In "development" build we will store user uploaded data in this folder. For easiness.
    -   In "production" build, we will user "/database/uploads" Folder.
    -   These all depends on ".env", UPLOAD_STORAGE_BASE_PATH and UPLOAD_STORAGE_FOLDER_NAME values. If gonna change make sure all affected place are checked. (Ex. Docker Nginx)
